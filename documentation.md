# HRMS Backend Documentation

## Introduction

This is the backend for a Human Resource Management System (HRMS). It is built with Laravel and provides a RESTful API for managing employees, departments, attendance, leaves, payroll, and documents. It uses JWT for authentication and Spatie's Laravel Permission for role-based access control.

## Features

*   User authentication (register, login, logout, password reset)
*   JWT-based API authentication
*   Role-based access control
*   CRUD operations for departments, employees, attendance, leaves, payroll, and documents.

    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`:**

## How to Run

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```
2.  **Start the queue worker:**

    php artisan queue:work
    ```
3.  **Start the Vite development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

You can also use the `dev` script to run all three commands concurrently:
```bash
npm run dev
```
